      <h2>Hello Friend,</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my world,
        <br />
        My name is Kenedy Musyoki, a junior full-stack software developer with one year 
        of experience in JavaScript, React, and Python programming languages. Other tools 
        I’ve worked with include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Figma, SQL, PostgreSQL, XAMPP, Git, 
        GitHub, and Postman. I'm currently learning Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am eager to learn new skills and contribute to the open-source community. I’m also 
        looking forward to collaborating on projects that bring my passion for coding to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am available for freelance projects, consulting, and mentorship opportunities. If you'd 
        like to discuss my skills, experience, or potential projects, feel free to reach out.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me!</p>
